# Cron Steps Guide

Cron Steps enable scheduled task execution using cron expressions.

They're typically used for recurring jobs like nightly reports, data synchronization, etc.

Cron steps can hold logic, but they do NOT have any retry mechanisms in place, if the logic 
is likely to fail, it's recommended to use CRON Step to emit an event to a topic that will
ultimately trigger an Event Step that will handle the logic.

## Creating Cron Steps

Steps need to be created in the `steps` folder, it can be in subfolders.

- Steps in TS and JS should end with `.step.ts` and `.step.js` respectively
- Steps in Python should end with `_step.py`

## Definition

Defining a CRON Step is done by two elements. Configuration and Handler.

### Configuration

**TypeScript/JavaScript**: You need to export a config constant via `export const config` that is a `CronConfig` type.

**Python**: You need to define a `config` dictionary with the same properties as the TypeScript `CronConfig`.

```typescript
export type Emit = string | { 
  /**
   * The topic name to emit to.
   */
  topic: string;

  /**
   * Optional label for the emission, could be used for documentation or UI.
   */
  label?: string;

  /**
   * This is purely for documentation purposes, 
   * it doesn't affect the execution of the step.
   * 
   * In Workbench, it will render differently based on this value.
   */
  conditional?: boolean;
  }


export type CronConfig = {
  /**
   * Should always be cron
   */
  type: 'cron'

  /**
   * A unique name for this cron step, used internally and for linking handlers.
   */
  name: string

  /**
   * Optional human-readable description.
   */
  description?: string

  /**
   * The cron expression for scheduling.
   */
  cron: string

  /**
   * Optional: Topics that are virtually emitted, perhaps for documentation or lineage, but not strictly required for execution.
   */
  virtualEmits?: Emit[]

  /**
   * Topics this cron step can emit events to.
   */
  emits: Emit[]

  /**
   * Optional: An array of flow names this step belongs to.
   */
  flows?: string[]

  /**
   * Files to include in the step bundle.
   * Needs to be relative to the step file.
   */
  includeFiles?: string[]
}
```

### Handler

The handler is a function that is exported via `export const handler` that is a `CronHandler` type.

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**
```typescript
/**
 * CRON handler accepts only one argument, the FlowContext.
 * 
 * The FlowContext is based on the Handlers which can vary depending on the config['emits'].
 */
export const handler: Handlers['CronJobEvery5Minutes'] = async ({ logger, emit, traceId, state, streams }) => {
  logger.info('CRON Job Every 5 Minutes started')
}
```

**Python:**
```python
async def handler(context):
    # context: object containing emit, logger, state, streams, trace_id
    context.logger.info("CRON Job Every 5 Minutes started")
```

### Examples of Cron expressions

- `0 0 * * *`: Runs daily at midnight
- `*/5 * * * *`: Runs every 5 minutes
- `0 9 * * *`: Runs daily at 9 AM
- `0 9 * * 1`: Runs every Monday at 9 AM
- `0 9 * * 1-5`: Runs every Monday to Friday at 9 AM

### Example uses of Cron Steps

- Sending email notifications on a regular basis
- Cleaning up old records
- Purging old data
- Generating reports
- Sending out scheduled notifications
- Collecting metrics from third-party services
- Reconciling data from different sources

## Examples

### TypeScript Example

```typescript
export const config: CronConfig = {
  name: 'CronJobEvery5Minutes', // should always be the same as Handlers['__']
  type: 'cron',
  cron: '*/5 * * * *',
  emits: [], // No emits in this example
  flows: ['example-flow']
};

export const handler: Handlers['CronJobEvery5Minutes'] = async ({ logger }) => {
  logger.info('Cron job started')
}
```

### Python Example

```python
config = {
    "name": "CronJobEvery5Minutes",
    "type": "cron",
    "cron": "*/5 * * * *",  # Run every 5 minutes
    "emits": [],  # No emits in this example
    "flows": ["example-flow"]
}

async def handler(context):
    context.logger.info("Cron job started")
```
