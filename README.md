# motia_dommi_app

A Motia tutorial project in TypeScript.

## What is Motia?

Motia is an open-source, unified backend framework that eliminates runtime fragmentation by bringing **APIs, background jobs, queueing, streaming, state, workflows, AI agents, observability, scaling, and deployment** into one unified system using a single core primitive, the **Step**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

This starts the Motia runtime and the **Workbench** - a powerful UI for developing and debugging your workflows. By default, it's available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

1. **Open the Workbench** in your browser at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
2. **Click the `Tutorial`** button on the top right of the workbench
3. **Complete the `Tutorial`** to get an understanding of the basics of Motia and using the Workbench

## Step Types

Every Step has a `type` that defines how it triggers:

| Type | When it runs | Use case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **`api`** | HTTP request | REST APIs, webhooks |
| **`event`** | Event emitted | Background jobs, workflows |
| **`cron`** | Schedule | Cleanup, reports, reminders |

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start Workbench and development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

# Start production server (without hot reload)
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start

# Generate TypeScript types from Step configs
npm run generate-types
# or
yarn generate-types
# or
pnpm generate-types

# Build project for deployment
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

## Project Structure

```
steps/              # Your Step definitions (or use src/)
src/                # Shared services and utilities
motia.config.ts     # Motia configuration
```

Steps are auto-discovered from your `steps/` or `src/` directories - no manual registration required.
